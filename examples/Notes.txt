Try to produces IBPs with exactly one term of highest order (in some sense,
see Jan's PDF), try to keep the order small. Motivation: At the end of the day
we want have a clear elimination strategy.

Problem: Can we generate enough IBPs to reach a triangular form?

Rethink David's Ansatz if there is a way to reach these IBPs by commutative
GB methods
